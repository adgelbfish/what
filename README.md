# Backstory:
The link to this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/k7hv95/what_is_the_longest_piece_of_code_you_can_write/) was posted to one of my social circles, and it caught my attention, mostly due to the bizarre looking nature of the title. So I clicked it, read it, laughed, but was left intrigued. So I came back to it, and eventually decided to create a solution. The most interesting part to me and probably the deciding factor in me deciding to work on it was the $1 gift card to Taco Bell, that I can‚Äôt use anyway because Taco Bell (at least to my knowledge) does not serve kosher food. Without further ado‚Ä¶
# General Analysis and Introduction:
The first thing that struck me when analyzing the problem was that the purpose of the code is obviously not for the output that the computer would spit out, rather for the reader. So I concluded it must be some sort of art form. In order to understand exactly what the author of the challenge meant, I needed to read the post again. And again. I would read, experiment, then read, then experiment, and with each iteration new understandings would pop into my head. While the result is far from perfect, with each iteration it gets closer. And now I present my solution to and initial analysis of the post.

# Breakdown:
## Title:
### What is the longest piece of code you can write to print, "Hello World" on the terminal.
#### Technical Explanation: Summary of Post
#### Semantic Explanation: Attention Grabber

-------------

## Introduction
#### We all know printing such can be accomplished in a tiny amount of code, however the hard thing is doing the opposite.
##### Technical Explanation:
Most coding challenges involve optimization of resources and how to accomplish a known task with fewer resources, the OP is clarifying that this is a different type of challenge. This challenge involves accomplishing the known task using more resources. Specifically with regard to code length.
##### Semantic Explanation:
The OP is trying to begin to convey the message that the goal here obviously isn‚Äôt the results of the code. There‚Äôs value in the artistic effort too. It seems that the OP is requesting an artistic portrait of a simple coding task.\

-------------

## Task Description
#### What is the longest piece of code you can write , without being dry, to simply write hello world on the terminal.
##### Technical Explanation:
Appears to be a question as to the readers capabilities wrt writing code that while only resulting in printing ‚Äúhello world‚Äù to the terminal, it is the maximum length the reader can produce, without being bland.
##### Semantic Explanation:
The artistic effort the OP is looking for is specifically one that shows purpose in spending effort on a task for an alternative purpose than the task itself. 

-------------

## Qualification
#### Each line of code must have a purpose, so no #'s.
##### Technical Explanation:
Seems that this means that the OP is judging challenge contestants based on the number of lines of code. In order for a line of code to be qualified it must display originality, therefore, contestants may not use numbers to artificially add lines of code. 
##### Semantic Explanation:
There‚Äôs no point in spending effort to duplicate what has been created already. Every line has to signify something. Don‚Äôt just duplicate things in order to stretch the code.

-------------

## Prize
#### The winner will receive a $1 gift card to taco üîî.
##### Technical Explanation:
The winner will receive a prize of a gift card to Taco Bell valued at one (1) U.S. dollar. 
##### Semantic Explanation:
In order for the contest to be real it needs to have a prize. But since the whole point of the contest is to show a certain point, the value of the prize is not necessary and a larger direct prize would only detract from the contest.

-------------

## Time Limit
#### You have until dec 15 to post your source code in the comments.
##### Technical Explanation:
The contest submission deadline is December 15th,  2020. All code needs to be submitted via the comment section on the original Reddit thread.
##### Semantic Explanation:
Every contest needs to have a time limit, so this one‚Äôs is December 15th 2020. The OP seems to be implying: ‚ÄúI want to understand the essence of your art, the source not just the code. Please post your submission by then if you wish to be qualified for my contest.‚Äù

## About This Post
#### This will probably die in new, but I'm bored and just want to have a little fun.
##### Technical Explanation:
The OP is stating that the OP‚Äôs belief is that this post does not have a high probability of garnering interest, but that the OP is willing to write it anyway despite that fact, because he has nothing better to do and just wants to fool around.
##### Semantic Explanation:
The OP is sharing that he enjoys this kind of art, and out of lack of something better to do, The OP shared the OP‚Äôs interests with the OP‚Äôs community in the hopes that the OP would find others who enjoy it too.

-------------

## Clarification
#### Edit: as a general rule if you can remove a line in your code, and it still works just the same, that line does not count to your final score.
##### Technical Explanation:
To clarify the qualification, it is not sufficient that each line be original. Each line of code must be necessary for the code to run. If the line is deleted and the code still runs, it doesn‚Äôt count. This further implies that the winner will be based on a tallied qualified lines of code.
##### Semantic Explanation:
Originality isn‚Äôt enough. This art needs to satisfy the shallow level, the deep level, and everything between. Also, the winner will be based on originality alone, lines of code that aren‚Äôt original don‚Äôt help


-------------

## Holistic Qualification
#### Edit2: Extra rule: it's for fun, so the parameters aren't that important as long as that is remembered.
##### Technical Explanation:
Due to the foolish nature of the purpose of this contest, the rules exist, but each individual rule isn‚Äôt important as long as the nature of the contest is remembered. This is a general qualification, and is definitely necessary for the nature of this contest.
##### Semantic Explanation:
The OP is trying to have fun with this art form and doesn‚Äôt want the answers to be technically correct but miss the point of the art. The OP doesn‚Äôt want the fun to be tainted by technically correct answers, and definitely won‚Äôt give the $1 Taco Bell gift card badge of honor to someone who is technically correct, but missed the whole point.
